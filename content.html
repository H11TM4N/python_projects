          2 years... Time flies o! It feels like it was last week that you sent
          that text saying "Just ask".

          I remember laughing when I saw it, thinking to myself "This girl...".
          I've been using that phrase ever since. Why? Because you never cease
          to facinate me.

          From the way you think, your sense of humor, the silly faces you make
          when I compliment you or make eye contact with you for more than 2
          seconds, Everything!

          You know... My source of motivation for working hard was simply my
          family. But after you came into my life, a Major source was added.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="mySlides">
        <p>
          There's no day that I don't think of the life and the family I will
          make with you in the near future.

      </div>
      <div class="mySlides">
        <p>
          In order to make sure that happens, I'm able to work harder and harder
          everyday.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="mySlides">
        <p>
          However, since I'm always looking so far into the future, I tend to
          lose sight of the present. For that, I apologize.

          I do have one request though. Talk to me. Yes that's the request. I
          know some things I might do would seem obvious to you but... God gave
          us the ability to communicate for a reason. So talk to me okay??

      <div class="mySlides">

          So... On this special day of ours, I want you to know that you mean
          EVERYTHING to me and nothing brings me greater joy than knowing that
          I'd spend the rest of my life with you.
